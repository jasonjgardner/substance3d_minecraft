# Substance 3D Minecraft Tools

Presets, guides, and filters for creating Minecraft content using
[Adobe Substance 3D](https://www.adobe.com/creativecloud/3d-ar.html) software.

## [labPBR Preview](./labpbr_preview/README.md "See Substance filter usage instructions")

This filter can be used in Substance Designer or Painter to show how the labPBR
specular and normal texture outputs will look. The textures are assigned to the
`user1` and `user2` channels, respectively.
